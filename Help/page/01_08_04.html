				<dt>Formula </dt>
				<dd> Formula for determining the effectiveness.<br />
                  <br />
Determine the referenced parameter using the strings below when entering a formula directly. Change "x" to "a" when referring to a value of the attacker, and "b" when referring to a value of the target. Entering "a.atk" refers to the attack power of the attacker. Additionally, you can reference the "n" variable's value by entering "v[n]". You can use the 4 basic arithmetic operator(+, -, *, /) symbols when writing your formula. <br />
<br />
When you enter "a.atk * 4 - b.def * 2", the value for the effectiveness of an item will be calculated as "(Attacker's Attack Power x 4) - (Target's Defense x 2)".<br />
<br />
Also, since the effectiveness of an item can change depending on the element and defense actions, these factors will not be included in the formula.

				</dd>
				<dt>Variance </dt>
				<dd>How much the effectiveness of an item varies (0 to 100%). Raise or lower the calculated effectiveness within the specified percentage. If the effectiveness is 100 and the variance is 20, the effectiveness will be a value between 80 and 120 (100±20).</dd>
				<dt>Critical Hits </dt>
				<dd>Specify whether or not an attack can critical or not by selecting [Yes] or [No]. When selecting [Yes], the chance of landing a critical attack will be determined based on the Critical Chance of the user and the Critical Evasion Rate of the target.</dd>
