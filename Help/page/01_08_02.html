		  <p> Class data is the collection of traits related to the abilities of actors. Actors must belong to a class, and things such as the way that an actor levels up, how their ability points increase, and the skills they can acquire are determined based on those parameters. It is also possible to give actors unique class traits. </p>

The EXP required for each level will be displayed in a list, and a graph will be displayed in the background in the [To Next Level] tab. It's a good idea to refer to this while setting your parameters. The total amount of EXP until reaching each next level can be viewed in the [Total] tab.

</h2>
			<p>In the [Parameter Curves] window, parameter values for each level are set based on the items below. By clicking the tab with the parameter's name, you can switch to the parameter that you want to edit. The value that you specify will be reflected when you click [OK] after you finish editing (changes will be abandoned when you press [Cancel]).</p>

				<dt>Quick Settings</dt>
				<dd>The values set previously will be applied to the parameter values for all levels. There are 5 types of patterns listed [A] through [E], and each pattern will be applied by clicking that pattern's button.</dd>
				<dt>Level/Value </dt>
				<dd>Directly edit the parameters for each level. After specifying the level (1 to 99) you wish to edit in the [Level] box, specify the value (Max HP and Max MP can be set from 1 to 9999, all others from 1 to 999) for that level in the [Value] box.</dd>
				<dt>Generate Curve </dt>
				<dd>The values of levels will be calculated automatically based on the values at level 1 and level 99. <br />
                  <br />
Define the values (Max HP and Max MP can be set from 1 to 9999, all others from 1 to 999) at [Level 1] and [Level 99] in the window that appears when the [Generate Curve] button is clicked. <br />
<br />
Next, decide the Growth Type using the slider. The rate of growth (the amount at which parameter values increase) when set to the left (Fast) will become lower when leveling up, and will become higher when set to the right (Slow). When you click [OK], parameters will be set based on what was specified.</dd>
				<dt>Graph</dt>
				<dd>The parameter values for each level will be displayed in a bar graph. By clicking or dragging within the displayed area, you can get the value for parameters for level in the location clicked.</dd>
