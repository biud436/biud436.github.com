		  <dl class="main__dl">
			<dt>Expressing Events </dt>
				<dd>The details of events expressed in the game using map events are defined following this flow: where (location), what kind of situation (appearance conditions), what action is taken (trigger), what happens (contents). <br />
                  <br />
Events such as characters and chests with items in them are expressed by assigning images to the map events which defined the contents of what happens. Also, processes such as moving between the outside and inside of buildings, cut-scenes that advance automatically can be prepared using events that do not have images. <br />
<br />
When creating an event, you first need to decide "where (location) and what happens) in the map view of the Main Window. After doing this, you will decide the remaining contents such as "what situation (appearance conditions)". </dd>
				<dt>Event Pages with "Conditional" Contents</dt>
				<dd>It is possible to change the details of what happens according to the play conditions of the game using map events. <br />
                  <br />
[Event Pages] are responsible for this. Event pages [conditionally] determine the contents of events. You can have one event with up to 20 event pages, and specify different images, triggers, and what processes are run for each. In other words, you can [conditionally] choose from 20 different events for one map event. </dd>
				<dt>Restrict Event Pages Using Appearance Conditions </dt>
				<dd>Deciding "what situation" to use the [conditional] event page is the [Conditions] parameter. Conditions are set based on criterion such as the values of [Switches] and [Variables], or "does the player have the specified item". <br />
                  <br />
Map events occur during gameplay based on the contents of the page which meet these conditions. When there are multiple pages which meet these [Conditions], the event page with the highest number will be used on the map. Conversely, nothing will happen on the map if there are no event pages which meet the [Conditions]. </dd>

		  <h2 class="main__title--h2" id="p02">Evaluating Play Conditions</h2>
		  <dl class="main__dl">
			<dt>Evaluating Play Conditions Using Switches </dt>
				<dd>Under [Conditions] in the event page, [Switches] and [Variables] are primarily used for determining the play conditions of the game. <br />
                  <br />
Switches record either the [ON] or [OFF] value. This is used for evaluating conditions of the game and state of progress such as "did the player accept the request from the king" or "did the player defeat the boss". <br />
<br />
The game will start with all switches set to [OFF]. On top of that, when running an event that changes the position in the game, the specific switch's value in the "contents" will be switched to "ON". <br />
<br />
By using that switch in the [Conditions] of other event pages, it is possible to use the switch being set to [ON] to switch the contents of the map event all at once. The games story can be built through continuously changing the state of the overall game through the changing of these events. </dd>
				<dt>Variables That Store Values </dt>
				<dd>[Variables] are what store arbitrary values (integers). The values at the start of the game are set to 0, and you can do calculations such as assigning values of your choice according to the state of the game or add to other values (use [Control Variables] event command). <br />
                  <br />
By using this variable, you can do things like change the details of events using the HP of the player and the amount of gold they possess, allowing you to finely control the map event conditions and results. </dd>
				<dt>Management Switch Variables </dt>
				<dd>It is possible to use up to 5000 switches and variables each in one game. Which switch number/variable, what state is evaluated is up to the creator. Use names that help you understand their purposes so that you do not confuse the relationship of the two. You can set their names in the [Name] field in their respective selection windows.</dd>
				<dt>Using the "Self Switch" for Autonomous Events </dt>
				<dd>You can also use "Self Switches" in map events. This switch can be used only in each individual map event. You can store values in the 4 types of self switches, "A" through "D", included in an event. <br />
                  <br />
This self switch is used for evaluating the state of events that are completed using self processing. For example, for treasure chests which contain items, by managing whether the chest was opened or not using self switches, and setting the contents for "before opening" and "after opening" in two event pages, you can make it so that an item can be obtained only the first time the chest was checked. </dd>
