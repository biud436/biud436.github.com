		  <p> The database is what keeps together all components that make up a game aside from the map and map events. Components such as the character that the player controls, items magic and properties can be prepared as the following 15 types of data. <br />
		    <br />
		    Data excluding [System], [Types] and [Terms] will be prepared for each type that appears in the game. For example, you will create data for each piece of equipment such as "Health Potions" and "Keys", and configure characteristics such as their names, images and what effects they have when used. </p>
