		  <h2 class="main__title--h2">Role of Data</h2>
		  <p> States are things like "Poison" and "Confusion", those abnormal states which affect the condition and actions of a character. Configure the specific effects in the data when a state is added. You can prepare not only states with negative effects such as [Poison], [HP decreased], but also states with positive effects such as [Enraged], [Attack Power Increased]. <br />
		    <br />
		    Moreover, State #1, named [Knockout], is a special state that is automatically applied to characters and enemies when their HP reaches zero. If all members of a party are in this state, it will result in a game over. </p>
