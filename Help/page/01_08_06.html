		  <h2 class="main__title--h2">Application Rules for Action Patterns</h2>
		  <p>Amongst the actions set in [Action Patterns], the actions which will be performed during battle will be decided according to the following rules.</p>
		  <ol class="main__ol">
		    <li>Those actions which fulfill the conditions will be picked out from the configured actions. No action will occur if there is no action that meets the required condition.</li>
		    <li>Within those actions that meet the conditions, the action with the highest rating and the action with a rating that is within two points of the highest rating will be treated as possible choices.</li>
		    <li>Amongst those possible choices, those actions which have a rating difference of 1 and 2 from the highest rating will have their chance of being chosen being 2/3 and 1/3 of the highest rating. The chance of being chosen will be the same for multiple actions which have the same rating.
<dl class="main__dl--sub mt10px">
					<dt>Example 1: The action rating is [5] and [5] </dt>
					<dd>The chance for each becomes 50%.</dd>
					<dt>Example 2: The action rating is [6],[5],[4],[3] </dt>
					<dd>[6] will be 50%, [5] will be 33.3% (2/3 of 50%), [4] will be 16.6% (1/3 of 50%). [3] will not be a choice.</dd>
					<dt>Example 3: The action rating is [5],[3] and [3] </dt>
					<dd>[5] is 60%, each [3] is 20% (1/3 of 60%).</dd>
				</dl>
				</li>
		    <li>The action used will be determined using random numbers based on the usage probability of those actions which are candidates.</li>
