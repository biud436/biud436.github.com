		  <h2 class="main__title--h2">What Are Events?</h2>
		  <p> In RPGs, the game processes through things that happen in the game such as conversations with characters, getting items from treasure chests and fighting with bosses. Using this software, you will prepare those things that occur using data called "Events". <br />
		    <br />
		    Events are the mechanisms for carrying out some sort of process. For example, when a player talks to a character, you can assign an image and the sentences that appear on the screen for the character that responds by using events. <br />
  <br />
		    It is a device which causes different things to happen in the game by running events depending on the play conditions and actions from the player. </p>

		  <h2 class="main__title--h2">Event Types</h2>
		  <p>Events consist of the following 3 types. Those events related to the game's story and progression are made using "Map Events".</p>
		  <dl class="main__dl">
			<dt>Map Events</dt>
				<dd>Events which are run on the Map Screen. Use this type of event to express things like conversations with characters, and chests from which players can get items. Additionally, you can define events related to the game's structure and progression such as players changing locations and cut scenes through events that don't have images.  <br />
                  <br />
To create and edit Map Events, switch to event editing mode by clicking the [Events] button in the toolbar in the Main Window (or by going to [Mode] → [Events] in the menu bar). </dd>
				<dt>Battle Events </dt>
				<dd>Events that are run in the Battle Screen. For example, these are used on events such as "Enemy transforms when HP is lower than the defined value". Create and edit these events in the [<a href="01_08_07.html">Troops</a>] tab in the database.</dd>
				<dt>Common Events </dt>
				<dd>Events that are commonly run. Use these to call Map Events and Battle Events, and setting events that occur when using special items. Create and edit these events in the [<a href="01_08_11.html">Common Events</a>] tab in the database.</dd>
