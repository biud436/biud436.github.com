		    <br />
		    The 13 types of effects that can be given are found below. You can create skills/items which possess a combination of effects by configuring multiple effects. </p>

		    <br />
		    The details of the configured effect will be displayed in the [Effects] list. You can re-edit the contents of effects by double-clicking the item. Additionally, you can perform actions such as copying the settings and deleting them in the context menu that is displayed when you right-click an effect. </p>
