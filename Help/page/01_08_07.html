		  <h2 class="main__title--h2">Role of Data</h2>
		  <p> Troops are the data for the groups of enemies that appear during gameplay. The enemies that you have the player fight with through moving in the map and command events are specified based on this data. Even when having the player fight against just one enemy, you must prepare data for the troop with that enemy. "Battle Events" (events during battle) will also be set for each troop. </p>

		  <h3 class="main__title--h3--sub"> Change BG </h3>
		  <p>Change the battle background that will be displayed in the Placement View. Specify the background using the left field, and the image used for the ground in the right field respectively in the window that is displayed.

		  <h3 class="main__title--h3--sub"> Battle Test </h3>
		  <p>Run a battle test with the troop. Specify the actors that will battle, equipment, and levels using the tabs labeled [1] through [4] in the window that is displayed (trait values based on the settings will be displayed in the [Status] section). A window will open and a battle will start when you click [OK]. The test will end when the window is closed.<br />
			* Save edited data when a plugin is set. When not saved, the plugin settings will not be reflected in the battle test. </p>
		  <h3 class="main__title--h3--sub"> Placement View </h3>

		    By dragging on an enemy in the Placement View, you can move the enemy. Additionally, when you right-click on an enemy in the Placement View and select [Appear Halfway], the enemy will become an enemy that will not appear until running an [Enemy Appearance] Event Command in the Battle Events. <br />

		  <h2 class="main__title--h2">Battle Event Parameters</h2>
		  <p>Configure event conditions executed during battle with enemies and their details in the [Battle Event] section. Just like map events, it is possible to divide the contents processed depending on the situation using the Event Page and appear conditions.</p>
		  <h3 class="main__title--h3--sub"> Event Page Controls </h3>
		  <p>You can control Event Pages using the [New Event Page], [Copy Event Page], [Paste Event page] and [Clear Event Page] buttons located on the left. The functions are the same as the map events.</p>
		  <h3 class="main__title--h3--sub"> Conditions </h3>
		  <p>Conditions for the event pages. In the [Conditions] window that appears when the [...] button is pressed, enable the conditions from the below 5 conditions, and configure the decision criterion used for each. Unlike map events, if you do not specify any conditions for the battle events, the event page will not be run. Also, if there are multiple event pages that fulfill conditions, the event page with the smallest number will be the one which is used.</p>
