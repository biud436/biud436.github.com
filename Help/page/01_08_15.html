		  <h2 class="main__title--h2">Settings Overview</h2>
		  <p> The [Traits] parameter for actors, classes, weapons, armors, enemies and states define the unique properties and functions for each type of data. <br />
		    <br />
		    The 24 types of properties that can be given are found below. By giving these properties according to the contents of the data you wish to create, you can give the various types of data complex traits. <br />
  <br />
		    Traits for classes, weapons, armors and states will be reflected in a character's traits when that character has that type of data added (equipped).<br />
  <br />
		    Furthermore, please be careful when configuring traits that permanently restrict actions. For example, a weapon which is set to [Lock Equip] cannot be removed once an actor equips it. </p>

		  <p> To set a trait, double-click an empty row in the Traits field. Select the property type in the displayed window, and specify what effects are applied. <br />
		    <br />
		    The property details will be displayed in the [Traits] list. You can re-edit the contents of properties by double-clicking the item. Additionally, you can perform actions such as copying the settings and deleting them in the context menu that is displayed when you right-click a trait. </p>
