		  <h2 class="main__title--h2">What is a Movement Route?</h2>
		  <p>A movement route determines how a player or event will move. This is set if [Custom] is selected in the event's [Autonomous Movement] settings, as well as when using [Set Movement Route].<br />
		    <br />
		    Either setting will be carried out in the [Set Movement Route] window. Routes can be edited when used with [Movement Commands] that control the movement, direction, etc. of the player. For example, entering in the [Move Right], [Move Down], [Move Left] and [Move Up] movement commands will cause the player, etc. to move in a loop going clockwise from their current location. </p>
